            Growing up, I was no exception to the stereotype that a kid’s favorite 
            question is “why”. I was always curious about the world, and I was 
            constantly encouraged to seek out answers to my questions. One question 
            that was frequently on the top my mind was how I could help people by 
            navigating through their feelings and improving their emotions. As a strong 
            empath, I wanted to create a positive impact in others’ lives from my 
            ability to discern and relate to what they feel. This led me to pursue a 
            psychology degree. Another question that I frequently asked myself was 
            how computers worked, and I can still remember my curiosity lingering as 
            I navigated through my favorite websites from a young age. I even enjoyed 
            the occasional keyboard smash, which would reveal a new feature of my 
            computer that I was unfamiliar with but brought me a new appreciation of 
            how complex this machine is. This led me to pursue a computer science degree. 
            <br /><br />
            In high school, I was officially introduced to computer science through the 
            Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, and my relationship with this 
            field was established. After spending seven weeks learning the basics of 
            how to code and engaging in hands-on opportunities to solve various 
            challenges, I was enticed by the limitless possibilities to create meaningful 
            change in the world. In fact, I was able to start there by merging my passion 
            for philanthropy and community service with my newly acquired coding skills. 
            With two of my peers, we created our very first project titled “YouServe”, 
            which is a website that allows users to connect with one another and diverse 
            organizations to find volunteering opportunities that align with their interests. 
            (If you are interested in checking this website out, you can find it under my 
            “Portfolio” page. Please be kind to my past self though; I have grown so much 
            from there!)
            <br /><br />
            Since then, my desire for computer science has only increased, and I have 
            been able to integrate some of my different interests into multiple aspects 
            of my work. For example, I have been able to use my computer science expertise 
            to assist with analyzing data in psychology studies while using psychology 
            research to guide my work in computer science. Additionally, I aim to use
            both of my degrees to identify intersections between technology and the human 
            experience so that I can discover solutions that are both efficient and 
            effective for users. It brings me so much joy and satisfaction to be a part 
            of this design and development process where we can resolve human needs and 
            problems through innovative means in technology, and I am so excited to 
            continue growing on this journey.
